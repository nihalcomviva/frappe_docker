## Objective

3. Added the following policy:
   > "All contributors must use their official organization email when making commits or pull requests. This ensures proper attribution, accountability, and compliance with company guidelines."
4. Saved the wiki page and verified the changes.
5. Captured screenshots of the updated wiki page as evidence.

## Importance of the Policy
